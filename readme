Facebook Lead Ads is a type of advertising format provided by Facebook that is designed to help businesses generate leads and collect valuable information from potential customers directly within the Facebook platform. It simplifies the process of capturing lead information by pre-filling forms with user data that Facebook already has, such as name and email address, making it easier for users to express interest and for businesses to collect leads.
